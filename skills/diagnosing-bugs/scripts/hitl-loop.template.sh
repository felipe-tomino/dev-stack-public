# Human-in-the-loop reproduction loop.
# Read and copy this template, replace the example with the exact symptom,
# and run only the adapted copy. This is not an install script.
# Use an interactive terminal; relay human prompts and responses through
# its input channel. Do not assume the user shares that terminal.
# Usage: bash path/to/adapted-hitl-loop.sh
#
# Two helpers:
#   step "<instruction>"          → show instruction, wait for Enter
#   capture VAR "<question>"      → show question, read response into VAR
#
# At the end, captured values are printed as KEY=VALUE for the agent to parse.
#
# `capture` prints its value back to the terminal, where the agent reads it,
# so capture redacted observations only; leave signing in to the user as a
# `step`. Never request or print credentials, cookies, or auth headers.
